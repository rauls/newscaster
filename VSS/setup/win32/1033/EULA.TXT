The Software may also contain third-party software programs.  Any such software is provided for your use as a convenience and your use is subject to the terms and conditions of any license agreement contained in that software.
2.	ADDITIONAL LICENSE RIGHTS -- REDISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  In addition to the rights granted in Section 1, certain portions of the Software, as described in this Section 2, are provided to you with additional license rights.  These additional license rights are conditioned upon your compliance with the distribution requirements and license limitations described in Section 3.
        2.1	Sample Code. Microsoft grants you  a limited, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to: (a) use and modify the source code version of those portions of the Software identified as "Samples" in REDIST.TXT or elsewhere in the Software ("Sample Code") for the sole purposes of designing, developing, and testing your software product(s), and (b) reproduce and distribute the Sample Code, along with any modifications thereof, in object and/or source code form.  For applicable redistribution requirements for Sample Code, see Section 3.1 below.
        2.2	Redistributable Code-General.

        2.3	Redistributable Code-Microsoft Merge Modules ("MSM").  Microsoft grants you a limited, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to reproduce and distribute the content of MSM file(s) listed in REDIST.TXT in the manner described in the Software documentation only so long as you redistribute such content in its entirety and do not modify such content in any way.  For all other applicable redistribution requirements for MSM files, see Section 3.1 below.
        2.4	Redistributable Code-Visual C++:  Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), Active Template Libraries (ATL), and C runtimes (CRTs).  If this EULA accompanies Visual C++, then in addition to the rights granted in Section 1, Microsoft grants you a license to use and modify the source code version of those portions of the Software that are identified as MFC, ATL, or CRTs (collectively, the "VC Redistributables"), for the sole purposes of designing, developing, and testing your software product(s). Provided you comply with Section 3.1 and you rename any files created by you that are included in the Licensee Software (defined below), Microsoft grants you a limited, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to reproduce and distribute the object code version of the VC Redistributables, including any modifications you make.  For purposes of this section, "modifications" shall mean enhancements to the functionality of the VC Redistributables.  For all other applicable redistribution requirements for VC Redistributables, see Section 3.1 below.
3.	DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER LICENSE RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS.  If you choose to exercise your rights under Section 2, any redistribution by you is subject to your compliance with Section 3.1; some of the Redistributable Code has additional limited use rights described in Section 3.2.
        3.1	General Distribution Requirements.  
        (a)	If you choose to redistribute Sample Code, or Redistributable Code (collectively, the "Redistributables") as described in Section 2, you agree:  (i) except as otherwise noted in Section 2.1 (Sample Code), to distribute the Redistributables only in object code form and in conjunction with and as a part of a software application product developed by you that adds significant and primary functionality to the Redistributables ("Licensee Software"); (ii) that the Redistributables only operate in conjunction with Microsoft Windows platforms; (iii) that if the Licensee Software is distributed beyond Licensee's premises or externally from Licensee's organization, to distribute the Licensee Software containing the Redistributables pursuant to an end user license agreement (which may be "break-the-seal", "click-wrap" or signed), with terms no less protective than those contained in this EULA; (iv) not to use Microsoft's name, logo, or trademarks to market the Licensee Software; (v) to display your own valid copyright notice which shall be sufficient to protect Microsoft's copyright in the Software; (vi) not to remove or obscure any copyright, trademark or patent notices that appear on the Software as delivered to you; (vii) to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Microsoft from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that arise or result from the use or distribution of the Licensee Software; (viii) to otherwise comply with the terms of this EULA; and (ix) agree that Microsoft reserves all rights not expressly granted.  
                You also agree not to permit further distribution of the Redistributables by your end users except you may permit further redistribution of the Redistributables by your distributors to your end-user customers if your distributors only distribute the Redistributables in conjunction with, and as part of, the Licensee Software, you comply with all other terms of this EULA, and your distributors comply with all restrictions of this EULA that are applicable to you. 
        (b)	If you use the Redistributables, then in addition to your compliance with the applicable distribution requirements described for the Redistributables, the following also applies.  Your license rights to the Redistributables are conditioned upon your not (i) creating derivative works of the Redistributables in any manner that would cause the Redistributables in whole or in part to become subject to any of the terms of an Excluded License; or (ii) distributing the Redistributables (or derivative works thereof) in any manner that would cause the Redistributables to become subject to any of the terms of an Excluded License.  An "Excluded License" is any license that requires as a condition of use, modification and/or distribution of software subject to the Excluded License, that such software or other software combined and/or distributed with such software be (x) disclosed or distributed in source code form; (y) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (z) redistributable at no charge.
        3.2	Additional Distribution Requirements for Certain Redistributable Code. If you choose to redistribute the files discussed in this Section, then in addition to the terms of Section 3.1, you must ALSO comply with the following. 
        (a)	Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine ("MSDE").  If you redistribute MSDE you agree to comply with the following additional requirements: (a) Licensee Software shall not substantially duplicate the capabilities of Microsoft Access or, in the reasonable opinion of Microsoft, compete with same; and (b) unless Licensee Software requires your customers to license Microsoft Access in order to operate, you shall not reproduce or use MSDE for commercial distribution in conjunction with a general purpose word processing, spreadsheet or database management software product, or an integrated work or product suite whose components include a general purpose word processing, spreadsheet, or database management software product except for the exclusive use of importing data to the various formats supported by Microsoft Access.  A product that includes limited word processing, spreadsheet or database components along with other components which provide significant and primary value, such as an accounting product with limited spreadsheet capability, is not considered to be a "general purpose" product. 
        (b)	Microsoft Data Access Components. If you redistribute the Microsoft Data Access Component file identified as MDAC_TYP.EXE, you also agree to redistribute such file in object code only in conjunction with and as a part of a Licensee Software developed by you with a Microsoft development tool product that adds significant and primary functionality to MDAC_TYP.EXE.
        3.3	Separation of Components. The Software is licensed as a single product.  Its component parts may not be separated for use by more than one user.
        3.4	Benchmark Testing.  The Software may contain the Microsoft .NET Framework.  You may not disclose the results of any benchmark test of the .NET Framework component of the Software to any third party without Microsoft's prior written approval.
4.	PRERELEASE CODE. Portions of the Software may be identified as prerelease code ("Prerelease Code"). Such Prerelease Code is not at the level of performance and compatibility of the final, generally available product offering. The Prerelease Code may not operate correctly and may be substantially modified prior to first commercial shipment. Microsoft is not obligated to make this or any later version of the Prerelease Code commercially available. The grant of license to use Prerelease Code expires upon availability of a commercial release of the Prerelease Code from Microsoft. NOTE: In the event that Prerelease Code contains a separate end-user license agreement, the terms and conditions of such end-user license agreement shall govern your use of the corresponding Prerelease Code.
5.	RESERVATION OF RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP.  Microsoft reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this EULA.  The Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Microsoft or its suppliers own the title, copyright, and other intellectual property rights in the Software.

You agree that Microsoft and its affiliates may collect and use technical information gathered as part of the product support services provided to you, if any, related to the Software.  Microsoft may use this information solely to improve our products or to provide customized services or technologies to you and will not disclose this information in a form that personally identifies you.

Microsoft is providing these links to third party sites to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link does not imply an endorsement by Microsoft of the third party site.
10.	ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE/SERVICES.  This EULA applies to updates, supplements, add-on components, or Internet-based services components, of the Software that Microsoft may provide to you or make available to you after the date you obtain your initial copy of the Software, unless we provide other terms along with the update, supplement, add-on component, or Internet-based services component.  Microsoft reserves the right to discontinue any Internet-based services provided to you or made available to you through the use of the Software.  
11.	UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES

For additional information see <http://www.microsoft.com/exporting/>.
15.	SOFTWARE TRANSFER.  The initial user of the Software may make a one-time permanent transfer of this EULA and Software to another end user, provided the initial user retains no copies of the Software.  This transfer must include all of the Software (including all component parts, the media and printed materials, any upgrades  this EULA, and, if applicable, the Certificate of Authenticity).  The transfer may not be an indirect transfer, such as a consignment.  Prior to the transfer, the end user receiving the Software  must agree to all the EULA terms.

17. LIMITED WARRANTY FOR SOFTWARE ACQUIRED IN THE US AND CANADA.  
Except for the Redistributables, which are provided AS IS, without warranty of any kind, Microsoft warrants that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying  materials for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt. 
If an implied warranty or condition is created by your state/jurisdiction and federal or state/provincial law prohibits disclaimer of it, you also have an implied warranty or condition, BUT ONLY AS TO DEFECTS DISCOVERED DURING THE PERIOD OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY (NINETY DAYS). AS TO ANY DEFECTS DISCOVERED AFTER THE NINETY-DAY PERIOD, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND.  Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty or condition lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
Any supplements or updates to the Software, including without limitation, any (if any) service packs or hot fixes provided to you after the expiration of the ninety day Limited Warranty period are not covered by any warranty or condition, express, implied or statutory.
LIMITATION ON REMEDIES; NO CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES. Your exclusive remedy for any breach of this Limited Warranty is as set forth below.  Except for any refund elected by Microsoft, YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, if the Software does not meet Microsoft's Limited Warranty, and, to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose.  The terms of Section 19 ("Exclusion of Incidental, Consequential and Certain Other Damages")  are also incorporated into this Limited Warranty. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.  This Limited Warranty gives you specific legal rights.  You may have other rights which vary from state/jurisdiction to state/jurisdiction. YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.  Microsoft's and its suppliers' entire liability and your exclusive remedy for any breach of this Limited Warranty or for any other breach of this EULA or for any other liability relating to the Software shall be, at Microsoft's option from time to time exercised subject to applicable law, (a) return of the amount paid (if any) for the Software, or (b) repair or replacement of the Software, that does not meet this Limited Warranty and that is returned to Microsoft with a copy of your receipt. You will receive the remedy elected by Microsoft without charge, except that you are responsible for any expenses you may incur (e.g. cost of shipping the Software to Microsoft).  This Limited Warranty is void if failure of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication, abnormal use or a virus. Any replacement Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer, and Microsoft will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide your remedy within a commercially reasonable time of your compliance with Microsoft's warranty remedy procedures. Outside the United States or Canada, neither these remedies nor any product support services offered by Microsoft are available without proof of purchase from an authorized international source.  To exercise your remedy, contact:  Microsoft, Attn. Microsoft Sales Information Center/One Microsoft Way/Redmond, WA 98052-6399, or the Microsoft subsidiary serving your country.

Si vous avez acquis votre produit Microsoft au CANADA, la garantie limitée suivante s'applique :
GARANTIE LIMITÉE
Sauf pur celles du "Redistributables," qui sont fournies "comme telles," Microsoft garantit que le Logiciel fonctionnera conformément aux documents inclus pendant une période de 90 jours suivant la date de réception.
Si une garantie ou condition implicite est créée par votre État ou votre territoire et qu'une loi fédérale ou provinciale ou d'un État en interdit le déni, vous jouissez également d'une garantie ou condition implicite, MAIS UNIQUEMENT POUR LES DÉFAUTS DÉCOUVERTS DURANT LA PÉRIODE DE LA PRÉSENTE GARANTIE LIMITÉE (QUATRE-VINGT-DIX JOURS). IL N'Y A AUCUNE GARANTIE OU CONDITION DE QUELQUE NATURE QUE CE SOIT QUANT AUX DÉFAUTS DÉCOUVERTS APRÈS CETTE PÉRIODE DE QUATRE-VINGT-DIX JOURS. Certains États ou territoires ne permettent pas de limiter la durée d'une garantie ou condition implicite de sorte que la limitation ci­dessus peut ne pas s'appliquer à vous.
Tous les suppléments ou toutes les mises à jour relatifs au Logiciel, notamment, les ensembles de services ou les réparations à chaud (le cas échéant) qui vous sont fournis après l'expiration de la période de quatre-vingt-dix jours de la garantie limitée ne sont pas couverts par quelque garantie ou condition que ce soit, expresse, implicite ou en vertu de la loi.
LIMITATION DES RECOURS; ABSENCE DE DOMMAGES INDIRECTS OU AUTRES. Votre recours exclusif pour toute violation de la présente garantie limitée est décrit ci­après. Sauf pour tout remboursement au choix de Microsoft, si le Logiciel ne respecte pas la garantie limitée de Microsoft et, dans la mesure maximale permise par les lois applicables, même si tout recours n'atteint pas son but essentiel, VOUS N'AVEZ DROIT À AUCUNS DOMMAGES, NOTAMMENT DES DOMMAGES INDIRECTS. Les termes  de la clause "Exclusion des dommages accessoires, indirects et de certains autres dommages " sont également intégrées à la présente garantie limitée. Certains États ou territoires ne permettent pas l'exclusion ou la limitation des dommages indirects ou accessoires de sorte que la limitation ou l'exclusion ci­dessus peut ne pas s'appliquer à vous. La présente garantie limitée vous donne des droits légaux spécifiques. Vous pouvez avoir d'autres droits qui peuvent varier d'un territoire ou d'un État à un autre. VOTRE RECOURS EXCLUSIF. La seule responsabilité obligation de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs et votre recours exclusif  pour toute violation de la présente garantie limitée ou pour toute autre violation du présent contrat ou pour toute autre responsabilité relative au Logiciel seront, selon le choix de Microsoft exercé de temps à autre sous réserve de toute loi applicable, a) le remboursement du prix payé, le cas échéant, pour le Logiciel ou b) la réparation ou le remplacement du Logiciel qui ne respecte pas la présente garantie limitée et qui est retourné à Microsoft avec une copie de votre reçu. Vous recevrez la compensation choisie par Microsoft, sans frais, sauf que vous êtes responsable des dépenses que vous pourriez engager (p. ex., les frais d'envoi du Logiciel à Microsoft). La présente garantie limitée est nulle si la défectuosité du Logiciel est causée par un accident, un usage abusif, une mauvaise application, un usage anormal ou un virus. Tout Logiciel de remplacement sera garanti pour le reste de la période initiale de la garantie ou pendant trente (30) jours, selon la plus longue entre ces deux périodes. À l'extérieur des États-Unis ou du Canada, ces recours ou l'un quelconque des services de soutien technique offerts par Microsoft ne sont pas disponibles sans preuve d'achat d'une source internationale autorisée.

You accept that no Software is error free and you are strongly advised to back-up your files regularly.  Provided that you have a valid license, Microsoft guarantees that a) for a period of 90 days from the date of receipt of your license to use the Software or the shortest period permitted by applicable law it will perform substantially in accordance with the written materials that accompany the Software; and b) any support services provided by Microsoft shall be substantially as described in applicable written materials provided to you by Microsoft and Microsoft support engineers will use reasonable efforts, care and skill to solve any problem issues.  In the event that the Software fails to comply with this guarantee, Microsoft will either (a) repair or replace the Software or (b) return the price you paid.  This guarantee is void if failure of the Software results from accident, abuse or misapplication.  Any replacement Software will be guaranteed for the remainder of the original guarantee period or 30 days, whichever period is longer.  You agree that the above guarantee is your sole guarantee in relation to the Software and any support services. 

Exclusion of All Other Terms - To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the guarantee above, Microsoft disclaims all warranties, conditions and other terms, either express or implied (whether by statute, common law, collaterally or otherwise) including but not limited to implied warranties of satisfactory quality and fitness for particular purpose with respect to the Software and the written materials that accompany the Software.  Any implied warranties that cannot be excluded are limited to 90 days or to the shortest period permitted by applicable law, whichever is greater.

Limitation of Liability - To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and except as provided in the Microsoft Guarantee, Microsoft and its suppliers shall not be liable for any damages whatsoever (including without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use or inability to use the Software, even if Microsoft has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  In any case Microsoft's entire liability under any provision of this Agreement shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you for the Software.  These limitations do not apply to any liabilities that cannot be excluded or limited by applicable laws. 

Consumer rights - Consumers in Australia, New Zealand or Malaysia may have the benefit of certain rights and remedies by reason of the Trade Practices Act and similar state and territory laws in Australia, the Consumer Guarantees Act in New Zealand and the Consumer Protection Act in Malaysia in respect of which liability cannot lawfully be modified or excluded.  If you acquired the Software in New Zealand for the purposes of a business, you confirm that the Consumer Guarantees Act does not apply.  If you acquired the Software in Australia and if Microsoft breaches a condition or warranty implied under any law which cannot lawfully be modified or excluded by this agreement then, to the extent permitted by law, Microsoft's liability is limited, at Microsoft's option, to: (i) in the case of the Software: a) repairing or replacing the Software; or b) the cost of such repair or replacement; and (ii) in the case of support services: a) re-supply of the services; or b) the cost of having the services supplied again.
